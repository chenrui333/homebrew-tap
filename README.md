### Package creation for personal accounts

I learned it in a hard way that there is no way to change the default package creation visibility from private to public.
However, for organization accounts, it is feasible to update the default visibility setting for package creation (see [this thread](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/65931#discussioncomment-7613551))
